# Serverlesss Svelte

This is a serverless Svelte app using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It uses Fastify for the web server. The demo site will feature an active/active deployment with latency based routing to highlight one of the advantages of serverless architectures - inexpensive multi-region deployments that add significant resiliency and performance benefits.
